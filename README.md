# hamiltonian-path-scala

### Problem description

A pawn can move on NxN (5 <= N <= 10) chequerboard horizontally, vertically and diagonally by these rules:

1) 3 tiles moving North (N), West (W), South (S) and East (E)

2) 2 tiles moving NE, SE, SW and NW

3) Moves are only allowed if the ending tile exists on the board

4) Starting from initial position, the pawn can visit each cell only once

This repository finds at least one path for the pawn to visit all tiles on the board following the above rules, starting from any tile.

### Solution

Since, finding the Hamiltonian Path is a NP-complete problem. Backtracking algorithm is used to find a possible path.
Using backtracking, in the worst case running time complexity is O(N!).

Initially, an adjacency matrix is generated according to the rules provided in the description section.
Then, from the user provided entry point, the algorithm tries to find a possible path using backtracking. 
When it finds a valid path, prints the results and terminates.

For most of the cases execution ends quite fast, however, in same cases it may take quite long to find a possible path, due to the nature of the solution.

(Note: Java solution can be found [here](https://github.com/canoztokmak/hamiltonian-path))
